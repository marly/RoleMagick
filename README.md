# Role Magick

## About

The Role Magick plugin (at a minimum) creates a 'partner' role, which is
modelled after a contributor, but with more restricted editing capabilities.
It also exposes the ownership of collections to Admin users and above, so
they can assign ownership of collections to partners.

More formally, a 'partner' will be able to:
  * Add Items, but only to Collections they own
  * Edit Items they own 
  * Edit Collections they own

And won't be able to:
  * Add or Delete any Collections
  * Delete any items (whether owned or not)

Eventually, the Role Magick plugin will allow roles with complex 
permissions over collections and items.
